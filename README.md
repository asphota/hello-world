# hello-world
This is first repository
I am new to github. I want to use this platform to make changes to R code more effectively. We are a group of five people( One Professor, one postdoc, two PhD and one masters students in Environmental Engineering at University of Cincinnati. We are working in the field of risk management for water resources. We want to be able to check and balance and divide the code for carrying out different tasks.
